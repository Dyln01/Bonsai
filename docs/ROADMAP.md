# Bonsai roadmap — the phase board, in-repo

**Living document.** This is the authoritative checklist (previously it existed only in
session notes). Update it in the same commit that closes/opens an item.
Format: GitHub task lists, so `[x]` renders as a checkbox.

## Shipped

- [x] **Phase 0:** Bonsai rebrand (remote URL, README, rebase on user's GitHub edits) — `70bc253`
- [x] **Phase 1a:** KV_TQ survey (kv_tq.h codecs, qwen36 KV8 seams, GLM wiring, container shapes)
- [x] **Phase 1a:** KV_TQ port — `patch_kvtq.py` applied (20 edits), engine builds, parity gates all green — `15bb6e7`
- [x] **Phase 1a:** launcher `Q36_KVQ` knob (f32|kv8|tq4|tq3) + engine synced to repo (md5-verified)
- [x] **Phase 1a:** 8-arm battery on synth_qwen27 — all rc=0; RSS ladder 805.6/673.3/649.9/641.3 MB, decode 46.9/26.6/5.3/1.25 tok/s (honest timers) — `d70b43d`
- [x] **Phase 1a:** ship — docs/KVTQ_QWEN36.md + results JSON + README updated; `15bb6e7`/`98073a5`/`d70b43d`
- [x] **Phase 1b:** kv_prefix reuse — MEASURED + shipped: 93% reuse through mux slot swaps, turns 2+ 10-12x faster; agent contract documented; `Q36_SLOTS` launcher knob — `67976ca`
- [x] **User ask:** full install guide — docs/INSTALL.md (Linux + Windows/WSL2), verified by executing its parity commands — `98073a5`
- [x] **User ask:** full command documentation — docs/COMMANDS.md: launcher, ~30 engine knobs, wire protocol, generators, drivers, patch order, parity gates — `b219e21`
- [x] **Softmax optimization:** `Q36_FAST_SOFTMAX=1` — 9.5-11.5x kernel, attn phase −6.5% (5/5 pairs), TTFT neutral, more accurate than stock; flash-site negative result isolated + documented — `3aa65fa`
- [x] **Phase 2a:** stock-safety regression — stock run rc=0 (RSS 3.03 GB) with the MTP head file present; MTP-unaware engines ignore `mtp.*` + meta keys, by construction and by measurement — `94ab7c1`
- [x] **Calibrate UX fix (2026-10-19, `test` branch):** `calibrate` looked hung on the mini-PC
      ("stops after warm log, >1 h, never quits"). Root cause: full-compute (`HOT_FRAC=1.0`)
      prefill over the WHOLE corpus at ~1-2 s/token on dense 27B × 4 cores, engine stderr
      swallowed to `/tmp/calib.err`, and the profile written ONLY at clean exit (a `^C` lost
      everything). Launcher now: streams stderr live, caps the corpus at `Q36_CAL_TOKENS`
      (default 1024; `0` = whole file), prints an ETA banner from the container geometry,
      and fails loudly with a pointer if no profile lands. Engine-side periodic save +
      progress lines tracked as **E7**.
- [x] **Phase 2 prep:** MTP design contract pinned (`docs/MTP_DESIGN_QWEN36.md`, `633d35a`) + synthetic head generator (`scripts/gen_mtp_head_synth.py`, `bcedf90`, shape fix `6d690e0`)

## Open — phases

- [x] **Phase 2b-1 — MTP head loader + knobs (2026-10-19, `test` branch).**
      `tools/patch_mtp.py` (7 anchored edits, backup `.premtp`): meta keys
      `mtp`/`mtp_layers`, knobs `Q36_MTP=1` / `Q36_MTP_DRAFTS=0..3` /
      `Q36_MTP_FORCE`, dense-head f32 loader via `st_find` on `m->S`
      (model-mtp.safetensors is already indexed — `st_scan_dir` takes every
      `*.safetensors`), refuse-gates (headless, meta-without-tensors, MoE head),
      report line `[qwen36 MTP] head loaded`, `q36_mtp_free` in the destroy path.
      CI gates: refusal rc!=0 with message; knob-on loads + token stream
      byte-identical to stock (head inert in part 1).
- [x] **Phase 2b-2 — MTP drafting + verify, dense head (2026-10-19, `test`).**
      `tools/patch_mtp_draft.py` (11 anchored edits, backup `.predraft`): head forward in the
      S=1 dialect (own f32 K/V rows, qk-norm, `rope_head_partial`, GQA scores over the head's
      standing rows, `softmax_row`, attn output gate, o_proj, y-ring); hidden capture at
      `step_ex`'s lm_head seam (ring of 8 settled rows); `q36_mtp_propose` (d1 from
      embed(tok)+hidden[pos-1], deeper drafts from the head's own hidden); source choice
      beside lookup via `spec_gate_pick` values; `sp->cur_src` in settle + report; head-row
      rollback = kv_len trim; `[qwen36 MTP] run:` report line. CI gate 3: greedy stdout
      byte-identical to stock for `Q36_MTP_DRAFTS` 0..3 with `COLI_LOOKUP=0 COLI_SPEC_GATE=0`
      (random-weight head => every verify rejects => rollback exercised every verify).
- [x] **Phase 2b-3a — force-oracle gates (2026-10-19, `test`).** `patch_mtp_oracle.py`:
      `Q36_MTP_FORCE=accept|mixed|cycle|rowN` drives the MTP proposal slot from ref.json's
      oracle ids; `DUMP_IDS` bootstraps ref.json in CI. Gates green: forced-accept ⇒
      acceptance 100.0% (7/7) AND the id sequence equals stock (the design's "reproduces
      the oracle text exactly" — the correctness proof of verify + head-row rollback);
      mixed/cycle ⇒ 60%/45.5% acceptance with the sequence STILL exact under rejections.
      Documented nuance: final logits may differ from a plain step when the last pick is
      answered from a verify batch row (pre-existing S>1 fp-order behavior, shared with
      accepted lookup drafts) — hence sequence identity, not logit bits, is the invariant.
- [ ] **Phase 2b-3b — MoE head + draft-cost battery.** Resident int4 experts in the head
      (bypass the LRU store), MoE-container CI gate, then the measured battery on real
      hardware (per-draft cost `d`, verify T(n), tokens/forward under forced acceptance)
      -> `results/results_mtp_q36.json` + `docs/MTP_QWEN36.md`.
- [ ] **Phase 3:** absorbed-score attention (FlashMLA-style, fold q·K per GQA group) — fixes
      KV8/TQ decode cost (KV8 −43%, TQ4 −89%, polar −97% in the KVTQ matrix) + O(T) long-ctx
      decay. Design-contract doc first (house practice), then implementation, then rerun the
      KVTQ 8-arm matrix + flash battery.
- [ ] **Phase 4:** windowing (sliding active-neuron cache, Apple LLM-in-Flash analog) +
      dynamic predictor (Deja Vu/ShadowLLM class, must beat GRIFFIN or stay a documented
      negative) + cross-engine KV8/TQ ports (GLM/qwen38) with per-engine parity gates.
      Grounding: `docs/RESEARCH_MAP_DENSE.md`.
- [ ] **Phase 5:** real-weights validation — GATED on user sign-off (breaks the no-download
      rule). Protocol doc first (eval set + checksums, perplexity arms, MTP acceptance rate,
      KV-tier quality neutrality, download budget + license check); execution only after
      sign-off; refresh README projected rows afterwards.

## Open — engineering / hygiene

- [x] **E1 — patch-script regeneration audit (CLOSED 2026-10-19).** Finding: the KV8
      part-1 patcher was never committed, the flash patcher had drifted to v2 while the
      engine carries v1, and the hotneuron/hotcal/griffin/mapfast/pagebatch patchers no
      longer replayed in any order (feature edits interleaved inside single diff hunks).
      Resolution: two byte-faithful regenerated patchers (`patch_kv8_flash_v1.py`,
      `patch_hotstack_v1.py`) derived from the committed snapshots; the FULL chain
      orig→premap→prehot→pretq→presm→final now replays byte-exact under
      `tools/verify_engine.sh` and in CI. Superseded per-feature scripts kept in
      `tools/attic/` with `ATTIC.md`. The README reproducibility claim is true again.
- [x] **E2 — harness files vendored/reconstructed (2026-10-19).** `scripts/make_synthetic_model.py`
      reconstructed from its contract of use in `gen_qwen27_synth.sh` (with the legacy
      `data_offsets` bug — see `fix_qwen27_container.py` — fixed; CI self-check).
      `scripts/iothrottle.c` reconstructed from the `REPORT.md` §0 spec (CI: build +
      bandwidth smoke). Originals were never committed; reconstructed files are labeled as such.
- [x] **E3 — milestone tags.** `phase-1a`, `phase-1b`, `phase-2a`, `softmax` annotated tags
      pushed; engine backups prunable once E1 closes.
- [ ] **E7 — engine-side calibration progress + incremental profile save.** The hot profile is
      written only at clean exit (`q36_hot_profile_save`, qwen36.c L7624) and prefill emits no
      progress. Design: periodic `q36_hot_profile_save()` every K prefill tokens + a
      `[hotcal] token i/N, elapsed` stderr line. Requires a compile-tested environment
      (mini-PC or CI with the full engine build) before shipping — engine md5 pins move too.
- [ ] **E4 — launcher `doctor` upgrades.** Report `Q36_FAST_SOFTMAX` engagement (AVX2 build?),
      `Q36_KVQ` tier, `Q36_SLOTS`, and `meta.mtp` presence in the container.
- [ ] **E5 — prefix-reuse regression gate.** Promote `scripts/exp_prefix_q36.py` to a
      fixed-seed gate with expected reuse % once CI can run the engine.
- [ ] **E6 — flash-site fast-exp retry.** The online-softmax negative result gets one retry
      with the block-rescaled form before it is considered closed (`engine/softmaxbench_q36.c`).

## Rules that stay

- No real checkpoint downloaded (Phase 5 excepted, by explicit sign-off).
- Every number backed by a committed `results/*.json`; decode numbers only from honest
  `[timers]` lines.
- Design-contract doc before implementation; negative results documented, not buried.
- Parity gates must pass in CI (`.github/workflows/gates.yml`) on every push.
